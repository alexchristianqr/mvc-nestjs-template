## [Module](https://docs.nestjs.com/module)

A module is a class annotated with a @Module() decorator. The @Module() decorator provides metadata that Nest makes use
of to organize the application structure.

## [Exception filters](https://docs.nestjs.com/exception-filters)

Nest comes with a built-in exceptions layer which is responsible for processing all unhandled exceptions across an
application. When an exception is not handled by your application code, it is caught by this layer, which then
automatically sends an appropriate user-friendly response.
